Figure (x-axis: iteration number, y-axis: loss values in training set)  
Results: report the classification accuracy on each fold  

Homework2:

Write a program for answer selection using RNN or CNN  

- Dataset

The dataset consists of three parts, namely the training, dev and test sets.  
Each row contains three columns separated by ‘\t’, namely the question sentence, answer sentence and the relevance label indicating whether the answer is relevant to the question.  
Please write a program using RNN or CNN to predict the relevance label in the test set. You can use Tensorflow, PyTorch or other frameworks as you like.

Homework3:  

Write an auto-encoder to obtain the 2-dimensional code of the image  

- Dataset  
Download:  http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/   
The dataset consists of a training set and test set of images. Each image is a handwritten digit.  
Please write an auto-encoder to obtain the 2-dimensional code of the image in the test set. You can use Tensorflow, PyTorch or other frameworks as you like.   

- Submitted files  
Source code   
Figure (a scatterplot about the 2-dimensional code for the test set, please use different colors to distinguish different digits)  

Mid and Final PJ:    
Implement a complete project with the algorithms related to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
